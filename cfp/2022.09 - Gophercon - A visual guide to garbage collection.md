# A visual guide to garbage collection

## Conference
Gophercon

## Pitch
Everyone knows about garbage collection, but few people understand how it works.
Using every day objects can help you visualize invisible concepts such as garbage collection.
In this demo you'll learn about what your software is doing when it's time to take out the trash.

## Description
Garbage collection is sometimes seen as a bad thing in software.
It's easy to blame pauses and downtime on things we don't understand.
Garbage collection has a lot of benefits and we'll show why it's necessary and what it's doing.
We'll represent it with physical objects so you can visualize what is happening under the hood and understand how it benefits your applications.
