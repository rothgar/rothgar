# Kubernetes home labs for any budget

## Conference
[Kubecon EU](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/)

## Abstract
In 2016 Justin sold all of his Bitcoin and bought a Kubernetes home lab.
The return on investment for learning Kubernetes has been more valuable than any crypto currency.
With 6 years experience building labs at various budgets he'll share what he has learned and suggestions if you're getting started today.

## Benefit to the ecosystem
Many people learn by doing and have limited budgets.
Kubernetes the hard way is a great learning tool, but to deeply understand how the underlying components work sometimes unplugging a cable is a better learning experience.
This talk will collect hardware options and suggestions for people building home labs today.

I will bring example hardware and have suggestions ranging from entry level to home data center.
