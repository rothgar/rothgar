# 2019.09 - Strangloop - Mastering zsh

## Track
other

## Abstract
In this workshop we'll start with a fresh zsh configuration and work our way up to advanced keyboard shortcuts and command line usage. We'll build from basics to show attendees how they can combine commands and shortcuts to meet their needs. We'll be building a .zshrc file as we go to make continued usage, portability, and tweaking easy. Various tools such as sed, awk, and jq will be covered as needed for examples. Attendees should be familiar with basic to intermediate shell usage and are welcome to bring their own tips/tricks to share.
