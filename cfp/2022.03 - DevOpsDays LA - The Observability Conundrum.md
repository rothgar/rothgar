# Monitoring Observability

## Conference
DevOpsDays LA

## Abstract
It's time we say goodbye to our good friend `print()`. The grep and bash that got us here won't get us where we need to go. Systems and applications have changed. Where does monitoring stop and observability begin? What can modern infrastructure provide for applications today? Let's look ahead by finding what worked in the past and what is missing.

## Describe audience
The audience should be systems operators and SRE who have a focus on building tools for application developers.

## Why this talk
There is still confusion in the infrastructure space about what is monitoring and what is observability. When to use each one and what benefits they have. We can explore the topics more to help people know when they need one or the other.

## Status
rejected
