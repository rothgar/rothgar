## Describe audience
Engineers who want to change the culture of their companies by using document first process and tools used at Amazon.

## Why this talk
Engineers are trying to change their process and culture to ship things faster and make better decisions. We'll give a first hand look at what it's like to have a meeting at Amazon for a new product.
