# Infrastructure as Software with GitOps

## Conference
GitOpsCon EU

## Abstract
The cloud has enabled abstractions and automation, but Infrastructure as Code (IaC) doesn't scale. You can use declarative YAML or imperative scripts and still lose control. Infrastructure as Software (IaS) allows you to control and scale infrastructure with the same practices as applications. GitOps is an implementation of IaS with lots of benefits over IaC. We'll look at how it's different, when you should use it, and where it potentially breaks down.

## Benefits to the ecosystem
The audience is users who are looking to understand why GitOps is recommended vs traditional infrastructure as code solutions. What problems are introduced with IaC and how an Infrastructure as Software (IaC) approach solves those problems.
