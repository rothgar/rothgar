# App native infrastructure

## Conference
[Platform con](https://platformcon.com/)

## Description
The days of "cloud native" dominance are numbered. It has served us well, but it's time for the next evolution of application-centric infrastructure to take its place. We can move beyond API driven low-level primitives and take the years of lessons learned to make them defaults for the platforms of the future.

## Abstract
We've successfully shifted the data center primitives into the API driven cloud. Security groups, VPCs, and virtual machines work well as building blocks when you have specialists who can maintain them, but the next wave of applications and developers won't have that luxury.

They build applications and bundle them with availability constraints, security boundaries, and networking as part of regular deployments. The infrastructure boundary is shrinking from companies, to divisions, to teams and individual apps. What does this look like for the applications and platforms of the future? What technology exists today to help us get there?
