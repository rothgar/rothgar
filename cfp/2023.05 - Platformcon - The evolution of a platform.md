# The evolution of a platform

## Conference
[Platform con](https://platformcon.com/)

## Description
Platforms evolve from client side to server side, imperative to declarative, and they grow in scope over time. What are the benefits and downsides of the different models and how will they impact your platform capabilities and long term goals.

## Abstract
When you set out to build a platform you have goals for what problems it will solve, who it will serve, and what it can do. The moment a customer uses the thing you built you'll know it was all worth it. A year later you'll wonder where you've gone wrong. What could you have done better? Why are you planning another re-write?

This doesn't mean you've failed or you need to start over. Sometimes you need to take a step back to understand the path forward. We will review different options for types of platforms. Pros and cons for each and when to be cautious to know you're building the right thing.
