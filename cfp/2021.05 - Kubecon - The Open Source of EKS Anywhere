# The Open Source of EKS Anywhere

## Conference
Kubecon

## Abstract
EKS Anywhere is a new open source project to deploy and manage Kubernetes in any environment.
It builds on top of the open source EKS distro and other community projects to provide opinionated tooling so you can gain from the expertise of how AWS runs Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
This presentation will dive deep into the technologies and how EKS Anywhere combines them to solve real world problems.

## Benefits to the ecosystem
This talk will go into more details about how EKS Anywhere works and how other builders can combine existing tools to create opinionated tooling for their own needs.
I know this sounds very much like a vendor talk and I work on EKS Anywhere so I am obviously biased.
I respect Kubecon and the community a lot so I will do my best to focus on the great work of the community on the projects that are used in EKS Anywhere, help users understand how the projects are combined, and help builders understand what they might want to consider when building their own cluster lifecycle tooling.
