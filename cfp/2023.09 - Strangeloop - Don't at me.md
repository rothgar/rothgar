# Don't at me

# Description

Social network protocols like Mastodon's ActivityPub and Bluesky's atproto are at the core of a new wave of social networks. They're designed with data ownership and distributed networks in mind, but they may not be all they're cracked up to be. Protocols are not products and we need to take a closer look at what compromises are made during implementation.

# Notes

This talk is an extension of research I've been doing around ActivityPub https://justingarrison.com/blog/2022-12-06-mastodon-files-instance/ and the atprotocol. The talk will show basics of how the protocols are similar and different and demos for implementing them and what trade-offs have been made in their designs.
