# Web scale open source with Kubernetes

## Conference
All Things Open

## Abstract
From hundreds to hundreds of thousands of community members, the Kubernetes project and Cloud Native ecosystem has thrived for the past seven years. Many companies have gone all in on Kubernetes, but how can a vendor neutral project provide stability guarantees that companies need? How can maintainers plan feature enhancements and react to security vulnerabilities? Everything from KEPs to SIGs, we'll look at the structure, process, and tooling Kubernetes has used to become one of the most active open source projects ever.
