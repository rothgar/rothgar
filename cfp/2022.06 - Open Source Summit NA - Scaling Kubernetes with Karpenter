# Scaling Kubernetes with Karpenter

## Conference
Open Source Summit North America

## Abstract
Kubernetes is the most widely used container orchestrator, but scaling workloads is not as easy as it should be.
Workloads are diverse, but we deploy them to homogeneous compute nodes.
This leads to complex configuration, label proliferation, and cluster sprawl.
What we need is workload native compute scaling for any Kubernetes cluster.
Karpenter is a new way to scale clusters by provisioning compute nodes that workloads need.
Heterogeneous compute infrastructure helps simplify configuration and utilize clusters for more workload types.
