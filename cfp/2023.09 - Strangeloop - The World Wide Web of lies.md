# The world wide web of lies

# Description

The Internet has connected the world and driven us apart. How the protocols designed to build bridges have created walls, and what the future could look like if things don't change.

# Notes

This topic is focusing on the technical abilities that have been used to disrupt information and freedoms. I will stay as much as possible in the technical implementations, but there will be some discussion of government censorship (eg great firewall of China) and other internets that exist outside general public knowledge (tor and dark web).
